## Subtype

[Subtyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping)

A subtype is a datatype related to another datatype(the supertype) by some notion of substitutability.

The program elements written to operate on elements of the supertype, can also operate on elements of the subtype.

If *S* is a subtype of *T*, the subtyping relation means that any term of type *S* can safely be used in any context where a term of type *T* is expected.


In a number of object-oriented languages, subtyping is called **interface inheritance**, with inheritance reffered as implementation inheritance.
